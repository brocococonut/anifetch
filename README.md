# AniFetch

A simple anime searcher and downloader with inspiration from the android app [Anime Scrap](https://github.com/fakeyatogod/AnimeScrap). The easiest way to run this would be to build the docker image and use that.

An example of running this via Docker is as follows
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/brocococonut/anifetch
# Enter the directory
cd anifetch

# Build the docker image
docker build .
# Output:
# ....
#  => exporting to image                                                                                                 0.0s
#  => => exporting layers                                                                                                0.0s
